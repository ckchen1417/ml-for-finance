## Welcome to Machine Learning for Finance in Python

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/ckchen1417/ml-for-finance/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

First, let's explore the data. Any time we begin a machine learning (ML) project, we need to first do some exploratory data analysis (EDA) to familiarize ourselves with the data. This includes things like:

    raw data plots
    histograms
    and more...

I typically begin with raw data plots and histograms. This allows us to understand our data's distributions. If it's a normal distribution, we can use things like parametric statistics.

There are two stocks loaded for you into pandas DataFrames: lng_df and spy_df (LNG and SPY). Take a look at them with .head(). We'll use the closing prices and eventually volume as inputs to ML algorithms.

Note: We'll call plt.clf() each time we want to make a new plot, or f = plt.figure().

Note: We'll call plt.clf() each time we want to make a new plot, or f = plt.figure().

Print out the first 5 lines of the two DataFrame (lng_df and spy_df) and examine their contents.
    Use the pandas library to plot raw time series data for 'SPY' and 'LNG' with the adjusted close price ('Adj_Close') -- set legend=True in .plot().
    Use plt.show() to show the raw time series plot (matplotlib.pyplot has been imported as plt).
    Use pandas and matplotlib to make a histogram of the adjusted close 1-day percent difference (use .pct_change()) for SPY and LNG.

### Header 3

    
print(lng_df.head())  # examine the DataFrames
print(spy_df.head())  # examine the SPY DataFrame

# Plot the Adj_Close columns for SPY and LNG
spy_df['Adj_Close'].plot(label='SPY', legend=True)
lng_df['Adj_Close'].plot(label='LNG', legend=True, secondary_y=True)
plt.show()  # show the plot
plt.clf()  # clear the plot space

# Histogram of the daily price change percent of Adj_Close for LNG
lng_df['Adj_Close'].pct_change().plot.hist(bins=50)
plt.xlabel('adjusted close 1-day percent change')
plt.show()

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ckchen1417/ml-for-finance/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
