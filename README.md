## Welcome to Machine Learning for Finance in Python

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/ckchen1417/ml-for-finance/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown


Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
Explore the data with some EDA
## Header 2
First, let's explore the data. Any time we begin a machine learning (ML) project, we need to first do some exploratory data analysis (EDA) to familiarize ourselves with the data. This includes things like:

    raw data plots
    histograms
    and more...

I typically begin with raw data plots and histograms. This allows us to understand our data's distributions. If it's a normal distribution, we can use things like parametric statistics.

There are two stocks loaded for you into pandas DataFrames: lng_df and spy_df (LNG and SPY). Take a look at them with .head(). We'll use the closing prices and eventually volume as inputs to ML algorithms.

Note: We'll call plt.clf() each time we want to make a new plot, or f = plt.figure().

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ckchen1417/ml-for-finance/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
